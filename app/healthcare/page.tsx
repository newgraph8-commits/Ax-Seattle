                  <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                    The growing importance of travel nursing across the healthcare sector is reflected in Ax South's
                    ability to mobilize a nationwide network of seasoned clinicians. Our nurses provide dependable
                    support during critical staffing gaps—including parental or personal leave, unexpected injuries, and
                    seasonal surges—and many are able to coordinate flexible scheduling directly with partnering
                    hospitals. This adaptability allows healthcare organizations to maintain continuity of care while
                    ensuring operational efficiency during periods of heightened demand.
