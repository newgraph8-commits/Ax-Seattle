                    Candidate selections are ultimately endorsed by company stakeholders, who hold the authority to
                    appoint, retain, or remove board members. Within this framework, our evaluation model prioritizes
                    identifying directors capable of offering both stability and forward-looking leadership to
                    high-performing boards.

                    Once this foundation is established, the assessment shifts to understanding how well a candidate's
                    judgment, temperament, and work ethic align with the board's existing dynamic. Key considerations
                    include:
