                    Our process typically begins with a diagnostic assessment of the organization's projected board
                    needs, supported by a thorough review of existing directors and an evaluation of the board's overall
                    composition, with cultural alignment serving as a guiding principle.

                  <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    From there, Ax Seattle moves through a coordinated series of steps that includes identifying
                    innovative board prospects, gauging their interest in serving, and aligning their backgrounds with
                    the qualifications required for the role. We also evaluate how each candidate might interact within
                    the existing board dynamic before advancing qualified individuals into curated talent pools.

                  <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                    Informal introductions are then arranged, followed by the collection of board feedback, the
                    coordination of formal interviews, and a refinement of the candidate slate to highlight those best
                    suited for the organization's long-term direction. The process concludes with the formal appointment
                    of distinguished candidates to the board.
