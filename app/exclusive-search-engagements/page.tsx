                Ax Seattle remains the sole point of contact from the initial search through a candidate's integration,
                ensuring consistency and avoiding the handoff model used by many firms. This continuity allows
                organizations and newly placed leaders to feel supported through every stage of a high-stakes
                transition—an essential foundation when the work is both critical and mutually beneficial.
